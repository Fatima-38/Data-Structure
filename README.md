ðŸ§  Data Structure Lab Work

This repository contains the implementation of various data structures as part of the Data Structure Laboratory course.
It includes practical programs demonstrating fundamental concepts such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hashing, along with their basic operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

The lab work aims to build a strong foundation in understanding how data is stored, organized, and manipulated efficiently in computer memory.
